**Below are breakdowns of parables/lessons that I learned from childhood within the first five minutes of the film Gladiator:**

After a historical backdrop in text finishes, the scene opens to Supreme Commander Maximus Decimus Meridius(referred to as S.C.Maximus), the great general of the last Good Emperor of Rome. He stands reminiscing of a location that brings him tranquility and happiness is quickly brought back to reality. He stands surveying the tactically terraformed battlefield just prior to the crushing defeat of the last German stronghold free from Roman Rule. This is the first parable. It teaches:

\- A great leader needs to be grounded

\- There is a time and place for everything

\- Men fight the strongest when there is something to fight for, which in S.C.Maximus’s case was conquering the enemy so that he may be released from service and carry out the rest of the days with his wife and son.

S.C.Maximus then walks from the front through the ranks of his soldiers, passing sight of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his royal guard to the presumably second and third in military command. The interactions between S.C.Maximus and his men alone is a parable illustrating what the ideal level of mutual respect and admiration between a strong commander, and strong followers. Another parable takes place while S.C.Maximus is walking and his face mirrors the faces of his men be they stoically steadfast or smiling. This teaches two traits needed in order to strive to reach being the best leader.

\- First, a strong leader must connect with the individuals that he commands, making direct eye contact at each of them as he walks by.

\- Second, pertains to the strong possibility that many of his men are about to die, which is a sadness that can only be compounded with the potential of defeat. This scene illustrates that even though it is a possibility of reality that no good comes from showing it, so instead a good leader should only show strength, which is visually expressed through stoicism or happiness.

In short, a good leader must mingle with the troops, and must always exude strength, especially so before battle.

Upon S.C.Maximus reaching his second and third in command, four enlightening things to quantify superior leadership are said:

1- The first thing S.C.Maximus asks his #2 if the emissary has returned. This should make clear the gravity of importance a great leader should place on up to date data. Or as Space Marines say, “Knowledge is power, guard\[the data and distribution pipelines\] well”

2- S.C.Maximus is then asked, “do you think they will fight?”. He immediately(because good leaders do not freeze when asked a simple question by a subordinate) responds with, “we will know soon enough”. This is a very low key example that a leader can only maintain strong trust with his subordinates if he speaks truth. Will they attack is a guess, this is an example of when it is okay to say “I don’t know” rather than “yes” or “no”. In this case, S.C.Maximus takes it a step further to speak truth, and also give a correct answer to what will happen in the future... which is that they will know soon, even though they do not know at present.

3- The second in command orders the heavy artillery be moved, which R.C immediately belays.

It should be noted that the second in command actually says “Soldier, I ordered(emphasis on the ed) you to move those catapults forward, they are out of range.”

Because I have already seen the movie, I have the foresight to know that this guy is a piece of shit which helps pick up on cues how not to be like him by seeing what he does wrong before the film makes it clear.

So let's break down the three lessons from what's wrong with that sentence.

3\.1- Do not fuck around with things that take substantial energy to move if they are already in a good enough position when battle could pop off any minute. Had his order been carried out, the heavy artillery would not have been able to contribute at the start of the battle which could have been catastrophic.

3\.2- As a leader if you issue an order and it was not carried out and it still needs to get done, there is a way to respond, and there is a way not to respond. A good leader will Issue the order again without addressing that the order was already issued and it was not carried out. There are a few reasons for this. One, it does not draw attention to subordinates that some in their ranks already disobeyed an order, which deteriorates Strength from the unit. Two, there is only one goal in issuing an order, get the task done, it is ill efficient to highlight the failure of the unit, and at the same time demand they carry out a task

3\.3- By already watching the movie, we can see that the heavy artillery is clearly not out of range, and to push them forward could negate the bonus of the terraformed kill box created by the Roman Army.

4- The second in command states, “People should know when they are conquered” to which S.C.Maximus then asks “Would you, would I?”

In this parable, S.C.Maximus emphasizes the importance of relating to ones’ enemy rather than making oneself cold in the heart to the enemy he was about to unleash hell upon. This shows that even in the extreme a good leader does not remove the bond of humanity from his enemies, which in my opinion is a very underrated parable.

The interactions end with S.C.Maximus mounting his horse to position himself for battle. It was at this point of the film that the first quality motto was imprinted into my mind and heart. Two powerful words that shaped my core values.

**“Strength and Honor”**

Thank you for reading my parable breakdown of the first 5 minutes of the film Gladiator Extended Edition.

\*May write out all the parables I observed in this film, then break them down, throw up some paywalls utilizing micropayments as a proof of concept. Perhaps something like $0.0002 per parable.

\*It should be noted that of the many diverse Roman soldiers shown(within the first five minutes), only S.C.Maximus and two of the Emperor’s guards were wearing animal skins over the armor. This in itself is very interesting and could make for a great topic of discussion.
